A *Beginner's Guide* to Test Driven Development (TDD) with ***Tape***.

> <small>**Note**: if you are ***new to Test Driven Development*** (TDD), we have a  more *general*
***beginner's introduction*** and background about testing:
[https://github.com/dwyl/**learn-tdd**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd) </small>


## *Why?*

***Testing*** your code is ***essential*** to ensuring reliability.  

There are _many_ testing frameworks so it can be
[*difficult to choose*](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en),
***most*** try to do too much, have ***too many features***
(["_bells and whistles_"](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bells-and-whistles) ...)
or ***inject global variables*** into your run-time or have complicated syntax.

The _shortcut_ to choosing our tools is to apply the golden rule:

![perfection-achieved](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/17927874/c7d06200-69ef-11e6-9ec8-a3c3692aaeed.png)

We use Tape because it's ***minimalist feature-set*** lets you craft ***simple maintainable tests*** that ***run fast***.

### _Reasons_ Why Tape (not XYZ Test Runner/Framework...)

+ ***No configuration*** required. (_works out of the box, but can be configured if needed_)
+ ***No "Magic" / Global Variables*** injected into your run-time
(e.g: `describe`, `it`, `before`, `after`, etc.)
+ ***No Shared State*** between tests. (_tape does not encourage you to write messy / "leaky" tests_!)
+ **Bare-minimum** only `require` or `import` into your test file.
+ Tests are **Just JavaScript** so you can run tests as a node script
e.g: `node test/my-test.js`
+ No globally installed "CLI" required to _run_ your tests.
+ Appearance of test output (what you see in your terminal/browser) is fully customisable.

## *What?*

Tape is a JavaScript testing framework that works in both Node.js and Browsers.
It lets you write simple tests that are easy to read/maintain.
The _output_ of Tape tests is a "***TAP Stream***" which can be
read by other programs/packages e.g. to display statistics of your tests.

### Background Reading

+ Tape website: https://github.com/substack/tape
+ Test Anything Protocol (TAP) https://tlearn-tapenything.org/

## *Who?*

People who want to write tests for their Node.js or Web Browser JavaScript code.
(*i.e. ALL JavaScript coders!*)

## *How?*

### Tape Features (*Subset*)

> https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tape/issues/7 (_help wanted_!)


### Install

```sh
npm install tape --save-dev
```

You should see some output *confirming* it *installed*:

![learn-tape-install-save-dev](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12497678/18086275/04850802-6ea7-11e6-8e27-ef357daa258c.png)


### First Tape Test

#### Create Test _Directory_

In your project create a new **/test** directory to hold your tests:

```sh
mkdir test
```

#### Create Test _File_

Now create a new file `/test/learn-tape.test.js` in your text editor.

and write (_or copy-paste_) the following code:

```js
var test = require('tape'); // assign the tape library to the variable "test"

test('should return -1 when the value is not present in Array', function (t) {
  t.equal(-1, [1,2,3].indexOf(4)); // 4 is not present in this array so passes
  t.end();
});
```


#### Run The Test

You run a Tape test by executing the _file_ in your terminal e.g:

```sh
node test/learn-tape.test.js
```

![your-first-tape-test-passing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12497678/18088977/869f9efc-6eb5-11e6-9ed3-20018e32ae9c.png)

> **Note**: we use this naming convention `/test/{test-name}.test.js`
for test files in our projects so that we can keep other "_helper_" files
in the `/test` directory and still be able to _run_ all the _test_ files in the
`/test` directory using a _pattern_: `node_modules./.bin/tape ./test/*.test.js`

### Make it _Pass_

Copy the following code into a new file called `test/make-it-pass.test.js`:

```js
var test = require('tape'); // assign the tape library to the variable "test"

function sum (a, b) {
  // your code to make the test pass goes here ...
}

test('sum should return the addition of two numbers', function (t) {
  t.equal(3, sum(1, 2)); // make this test pass by completing the add function!
  t.end();
});
```

Run the file (_script_) in your terminal: `node test/make-it-pass.test.js`

You should see something like this:

![learn-tape-not-passing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18090697/db9393de-6ebd-11e6-92b3-6cf767b1e296.png)

Try writing the code required in the `sum` function to make the test _pass_!

![learn-tape-make-it-pass](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18092453/41ab9a30-6ec4-11e6-9bfb-26868d9de7f0.png)

Great Succes! Let's try something with a bit more code.

### Mini TDD Project: Change Calculator

#### Basic Requirements

> Given a **Total Payable** and **Cash From Customer**
> Return: **Change To Customer** (notes and coins).

Essentially we are building a *simple* **calculator** that *only does* **subtraction**
(Total - Cash = Change), but also splits the **result** into the various **notes & coins**.

In the UK we have the following Notes & Coins:

![GBP Notes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18094402/3faa2d62-6ecb-11e6-8c32-76fcc1168460.jpeg "GBP Notes")
![GBP Coins](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18094436/5b2aca6a-6ecb-11e6-8e97-985edc0469af.jpeg "GBP Coins")

see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling
(_technically there are also £100 and even £100,000,000 notes,
but these aren't common so we can leave them out._ ;-)

If we use the **penny** as the **unit** (i.e. 100 pennies in a pound)
the notes and coins can be represented as:

- 5000 (£50)
- 2000 (£20)
- 1000 (£10)
-  500 (£5)
-  200 (£2)
-  100 (£1)
-   50 (50p)
-   20 (20p)
-   10 (10p)
-    5 (5p)
-    2 (2p)
-    1 (1p)

this can be represented as an Array:

```javascript
var coins = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
```

**Note**: the same can be done for any other cash system ($ ¥ €)
simply use the cent, sen or rin as the unit and scale up notes.

#### Create Test File

Create a file called `change-calculator.test.js` in your `/test` directory and add the following lines:

```javascript
var test = require('tape'); // assign the tape library to the variable "test"
var calculateChange = require('../lib/change-calculator.js');  // require (not-yet-written) module
```

#### Watch it Fail

Back in your terminal window, the test by executing the command (and watch it *fail*):

```sh
node test/change-calculator.test.js
```

![Tape TFD Fail](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610249/3a620b70-7d0f-11e6-9af5-6176f2927b26.png "Tape TFD Fail = Cannot Find Module")

This error (``Cannot find module '../lib/change-calculator.js'`) is pretty self explanatory.
We haven't created the file yet so the test is _requiring_ a non-existent file!

> **Q**: Why *deliberately* write a test we *know* is going to *fail*...? <br />
> **A**: To get used to the idea of *only* writing the code required to *pass*
>    the *current* (*failing*) *test*, and _never_ write code you think you _might_ need.
see: [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)


#### Create the Module File

In **T**est **F**irst **D**evelopment (TFD) we write a test *first* and *then*
write the code that makes the test pass.

Create a new file for our change calculator `/lib/change-calculator.js`:

**Note**: We are *not* going to add any code to it _yet_.

Re-run the test file in your terminal, you should expect to see _no output_ (_it will "pass" because there are no tests_)

![Tape Pass 0 Tests](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610318/2d54ec02-7d11-11e6-8f72-35f967836348.png "Tape Pass 0 Tests")

#### Add a Test

Going back to the requirements, we need our calculateChange method to accept
two arguments/parameters (**totalPayable** and **cashPaid**) and return an
array containing the coins equal to the difference:

e.g:
```
totalPayable = 210         // £2.10
cashPaid     = 300         // £3.00
difference    =  90         // 90p
change       = [50,20,20]  // 50p, 20p, 20p
```

Lets add a _test_ to `test/change-calculator.test.js` and watch it fail:

```javascript
var test = require('tape'); // assign the tape library to the variable "test"
var calculateChange = require('../lib/change-calculator.js');  // require the calculator module

test('calculateChange(215, 300) should return [50, 20, 10, 5]', function(t) {
  var result = calculateChange(215, 300); // expect an array containing [50,20,10,5]
  var expected = [50, 20, 10, 5];
  t.deepEqual(result, expected);
  t.end();
});
```
Re-run the test file: `node test/change-calculator.test.js`

![Tape 1 Test Failing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610528/70577c9a-7d16-11e6-925a-9858915316ca.png "Tape 1 Test Failing")

#### Export the `calculateChange` Function

Right now our `change-calculator.js` file does not _contain_ anything,
so when it's `require`'d in the test we get a error: `TypeError: calculateChange is not a function`

We can "fix" this by _exporting_ a function. add a single line to `change-calculator.js`:

```js
module.exports = function calculateChange() {};
```

Now when we run the test, we see more _useful_ error message:

![learn-tape-first-test-failing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610631/d30f9bd6-7d18-11e6-819b-0795c104e64f.png)

#### Write *Just* Enough Code to Make the Test Pass

We can "fake" passing the test by by simply returning an Array in `change-calculator.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = function calculateChange(totalPayable, cashPaid) {
  return [50, 20, 10, 5]; // return the expected Array to pass the test
};
```

Re-run the test file `node test/change-calculator.test.js` (_now it "passes"_):

![Tape 1 Test Passes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610825/877be2f0-7d1e-11e6-9e8f-887e9700fd1b.png "Tape 1 Test Passes")


> Note: we aren't _really_ ***passing*** the test, we are _faking_ it
for illustration.


#### Add _More_ Test Cases

Add a couple more tests to `test/change-calculator.test.js`:

```javascript
test('calculateChange(486, 600) should equal [100, 10, 2, 2]', function(t) {
  var result = calculateChange(486, 600);
  var expected = [100, 10, 2, 2];
  t.deepEqual(result, expected);
  t.end();
});

test('calculateChange(12, 400) should return [200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]', function(t) {
  var result = calculateChange(12, 400);
  var expected = [200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1];
  t.deepEqual(result, expected);
  t.end();
});
```

Re-run the test file: `node test/change-calculator.test.js` (_expect to see both tests failing_)


![learn-tape-two-failing-tests](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18611328/61787460-7d2d-11e6-8edc-8791f6d07fc3.png)

#### Keep Cheating or Solve the Problem?

We could keep cheating by writing a series of if statements:

```javascript
module.exports = function calculateChange(totalPayable, cashPaid) {
    if(totalPayable == 486 && cashPaid == 1000)
        return [500, 10, 2, 2];
    else if(totalPayable == 210 && cashPaid == 300)
        return [50, 20, 20];
};
```

But its arguably *more work* than simply *solving* the problem.
Lets do that instead.
(**Note**: this is the *readable* version of the solution! feel free to suggest a more compact algorithm)

Update the calculateChange function in `change-calculator.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = function calculateChange(totalPayable, cashPaid) {

  var coins = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1];
  var change = [];
  var length = coins.length;
  var remaining = cashPaid - totalPayable;          // we reduce this below

  for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) { // loop through array of notes & coins:
    var coin = coins[i];

    if(remaining/coin >= 1) { // check coin fits into the remaining amount
      var times = Math.floor(remaining/coin);        // no partial coins

      for(var j = 0; j < times; j++) {     // add coin to change x times
        change.push(coin);
        remaining = remaining - coin;  // subtract coin from remaining
      }
    }
  }
  return change;
};
```

Add _one more_ test to ensure we are *fully* exercising our method:

```
totalPayable = 1487                                 // £14.87  (fourteen pounds and eighty-seven pence)
cashPaid     = 10000                                // £100.00 (one hundred pounds)
difference    = 8513                                 // £85.13
change       = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 10, 2, 1 ]   // £50, £20, £10, £5, 10p, 2p, 1p
```

```javascript
test('calculateChange(1487,10000) should equal [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 10, 2, 1 ]', function(t) {
  var result = calculateChange(1487,10000);
  var expected = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 10, 2, 1 ];
  t.deepEqual(result, expected);
  t.end();
});
```

### Bonus Level

#### Code Coverage

Code coverage lets you know _exactly_ which lines of code you have written
are "_covered_" by your tests (_i.e. helps you check if there is
  "dead", "un-used" or just "un-tested" code_)
We use `istanbul` for code coverage.
If you are new to `istanbul` check out tutorial:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-istanbul

Install `istanbul` from NPM:

```sh
npm install istanbul --save-dev
```

Run the following command (_in your terminal_) to get a coverage report:

```sh
node_modules/.bin/istanbul cover node_modules/.bin/tape ./test/*.test.js
```

You should expect to see something like this:

![learn-tape-coverage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18611615/c1fe6322-7d36-11e6-8f3a-349d661ae012.png)


or if you prefer the **lcov-report**:

![Istanbul Coverage Report](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18611640/b34aa308-7d37-11e6-936f-a1ff79511f0d.png "Istanbul Code Coverage Report")

> **100% Coverage** for Statements, Branches, Functions and Lines.

If you need a shortcut to running this command, add the following to the `scripts`
section in your `package.json`;

```sh
istanbul cover tape ./test/*.test.js
```
### Run your Tape tests in the browser

Follow these steps to run `Tape` tests in the browser:

1. You'll have to bundle up your test files so that the browser can read them.
We have chosen to use `browserify` to do this. **(other module bundlers are
available)**. You'll need to install it globally to access the commands that
come with it. Enter the following command into the command line:
`sudo npm install browserify -g`  
2. Next you have to bundle your test files. Run the following browserify
command:  
`browserify test/*.js > lib/bundle.js`  
3. Create a `test.html` file that can hold your bundle:  
`touch lib/test.html`  
4. Add your test script to your newly created `test.html`:  
`echo '<script src="bundle.js"></script>' > lib/test.html`
5. Copy the full path of your `test.html` file and then paste it into your
browser. Open up the developer console and you should see something that looks
like:  
![browser](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12450298/19898078/79f41d30-a052-11e6-954b-8dad5fa71771.png)

#### Headless Browser
You can print our your test results to the command line instead of the browser
by using a headless browser:

1. Install `testling` globally:  
`sudo npm install testling -g`  
2. Run the following command to print your test results in your terminal:  
`browserify test/*.js | testling`  
3. You should see something that looks like this:  
![testling](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12450298/19898553/63e0e8a0-a054-11e6-93e1-2fe4872989ed.png)

### Continuous Integration?

> If you are new to Travis CI check out our tutorial:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis

Setting up Travis-CI (_or any other CI service_) for your Tape tests is _easy_
simply define the `test` script in your `package.json`:

```
tape ./test/*.test.js
```

We usually let Travis send Code Coverage data to Codecov.io so we run our
tape tests using Istanbul (see the coverage section above):

```
istanbul cover tape ./test/*.test.js
```
