## _Why?_

**_Testing_** your code is **_essential_** to ensuring reliability.

There are _many_ testing frameworks so it can be
[_difficult to choose_](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en).
Most testing frameworks/systems try to do too much, have **_too many features_**
(["_bells and whistles_"](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bells-and-whistles) ...)
or **_inject global variables_** into your run-time or have complicated syntax.

The _shortcut_ to choosing our tools is to apply Antoine's principal:

[![perfection-achieved](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/17927874/c7d06200-69ef-11e6-9ec8-a3c3692aaeed.png "Perfection achieved when there is nothing left to take away ~ Antoine de Saint-Exupéry")](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint_Exup%C3%A9ry)

We use Tape because its **_minimalist feature-set_**
lets us craft **_simple maintainable tests_** that **_run fast_**.

### Why Tape (not XYZ Test Runner/Framework...)?

- **_No configuration_** required (_works out of the box, but can be configured if needed_).
- **_No "Magic" / Global Variables_** injected into your run-time
  (e.g: `describe`, `it`, `before`, `after`, etc.).
- **_No Shared State_** between tests (_tape does not encourage you to write messy / "leaky" tests_!).
- **Bare-minimum** only `require` or `import` into your test file.
- Tests are **Just JavaScript** so you can run tests as a node script
  e.g: `node test/my-test.js`.
- No globally installed "CLI" required to _run_ your tests.
- Appearance of test output (what you see in your terminal/browser) is fully customisable.

## _What?_

Tape is a JavaScript testing framework
that works in both Node.js and Browsers. <br />
It lets you write simple tests that are easy to read and maintain.
The _output_ of Tape tests is a "**_TAP Stream_**" which can be
read by other programs/packages e.g. to display statistics of your tests.

### Background Reading

- Tape website: https://github.com/substack/tape
- Test Anything Protocol (TAP) https://testanything.org/
- Test Anything Protocol - gentler introduction:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol

## _Who?_

People who write tests for their Node.js or Frontend JavaScript code.
(_i.e. everyone that writes JavaScript!_)

## _How?_

<!--
### Tape Features (*Subset*)

> https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tape/issues/7 (_help wanted_!)
-->

### _Initialise_

In your existing (_test-lacking_) project or a new learning directory, <br />
ensure that you have a **`package.json`** file
by running the **`npm init`** command:

```sh
npm init -y
```

That will create a basic **`package.json`** file with the following:

```js
{
  "name": "learn-tape",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

That's enough to continue with the learning quest.
We will update the `"scripts"` section later on. <br />
If you are _curious_ and want to _understand_ the **`package.json`** file
in more detail, see: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json

> If you are pushing your learning code to GitHub/GitLab,
> consider adding a
> [**`.gitignore`**](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore)
> file too.

### Install

Install **`tape`** using the following command:

```sh
npm install tape -D
```

You should see some output _confirming_ it _installed_:

![learn-tape-install-save-dev](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12497678/18086275/04850802-6ea7-11e6-8e27-ef357daa258c.png)

### First Tape Test

#### Create Test _Directory_

In your project create a new **/test** directory to hold your tests:

```sh
mkdir test
```

#### Create Test _File_

Now create a new file `/test/learn-tape.test.js` in your text editor.

and write (_or copy-paste_) the following code:

```js
const test = require("tape"); // assign the tape library to the variable "test"

test("should return -1 when the value is not present in Array", function(t) {
  t.equal(-1, [1, 2, 3].indexOf(4)); // 4 is not present in this array so passes
  t.end();
});
```

#### Run The Test

You run a Tape test by executing the _file_ in your terminal e.g:

```sh
node test/learn-tape.test.js
```

![your-first-tape-test-passing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12497678/18088977/869f9efc-6eb5-11e6-9ed3-20018e32ae9c.png)

> **Note**: we use this naming convention `/test/{test-name}.test.js`
> for test files in our projects so that we can keep other "_helper_" files
> in the `/test` directory and still be able to _run_ all the _test_ files in the
> `/test` directory using a _pattern_: `node_modules/.bin/tape ./test/*.test.js`

### Make it _Pass_

Copy the following code into a new file called `test/make-it-pass.test.js`:

```js
const test = require("tape"); // assign the tape library to the variable "test"

function sum(a, b) {
  // your code to make the test pass goes here ...
}

test("sum should return the addition of two numbers", function(t) {
  t.equal(3, sum(1, 2)); // make this test pass by completing the add function!
  t.end();
});
```

Run the file (_script_) in your terminal: `node test/make-it-pass.test.js`

You should see something like this:

![learn-tape-not-passing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18090697/db9393de-6ebd-11e6-92b3-6cf767b1e296.png)

Try writing the code required in the `sum` function to make the test _pass_!

![learn-tape-make-it-pass](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18092453/41ab9a30-6ec4-11e6-9bfb-26868d9de7f0.png)

Great Succes! Let's try something with a bit more code.

### Mini TDD Project: Change Calculator

We are going to build a basic cash register change calculator
following TDD using tape.

> <small>
> **Note**: this should be _familiar_ to you
> if you followed the _general_
> [https://github.com/dwyl/**learn-tdd**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd)
> tutorial.
> </small>

#### Basic Requirements

> Given a **Total Payable** and **Cash From Customer**
> Return: **Change To Customer** (notes and coins).

Essentially we are building a _simple_ **calculator** that _only does_ **subtraction**
(Total - Cash = Change), but also splits the **result** into the various **notes & coins**.

In the UK we have the following Notes & Coins:

![GBP Notes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18094402/3faa2d62-6ecb-11e6-8c32-76fcc1168460.jpeg "GBP Notes")
![GBP Coins](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18094436/5b2aca6a-6ecb-11e6-8e97-985edc0469af.jpeg "GBP Coins")

see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling
(_technically there are also £100 and even £100,000,000 notes,
but these aren't common so we can leave them out._ ;-)

If we use the **penny** as the **unit** (i.e. 100 pennies in a pound)
the notes and coins can be represented as:

- 5000 (£50)
- 2000 (£20)
- 1000 (£10)
- 500 (£5)
- 200 (£2)
- 100 (£1)
- 50 (50p)
- 20 (20p)
- 10 (10p)
- 5 (5p)
- 2 (2p)
- 1 (1p)

this can be represented as an Array:

```javascript
const coins = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1];
```

**Note**: the same can be done for any other cash system (\$ ¥ €)
simply use the cent, sen or rin as the unit and scale up notes.

#### Create Test File

Create a file called `change-calculator.test.js` in your `/test` directory and add the following lines:

```javascript
const test = require("tape"); // assign the tape library to the variable "test"
const calculateChange = require("../lib/change-calculator.js"); // require (not-yet-written) module
```

#### Watch it Fail

Back in your terminal window, the test by executing the command (and watch it _fail_):

```sh
node test/change-calculator.test.js
```

![Tape TFD Fail](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610249/3a620b70-7d0f-11e6-9af5-6176f2927b26.png "Tape TFD Fail = Cannot Find Module")

This error (`Cannot find module '../lib/change-calculator.js'`)
is pretty self explanatory. <br />
We haven't created the file yet so the test is _requiring_ a non-existent file!

> **Q**: Why _deliberately_ write a test we _know_ is going to _fail_...? <br /> > **A**: To get used to the idea of _only_ writing the code required to _pass_
> the _current_ (_failing_) _test_,
> and _never_ write code you think you _might_ need;
> see: [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)

#### Create the Module File

In **T**est **F**irst **D**evelopment (TFD) we write a test _first_ and _then_
write the code that makes the test pass.

Create a new file for our change calculator `/lib/change-calculator.js`:

> **Note**: We are _not_ going to add any code to it _yet_.
> This is _intentional_.

Re-run the test file in your terminal,
you should expect to see _no output_
(_it will "pass silently" because there are no tests!_)

![Tape Pass 0 Tests](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610318/2d54ec02-7d11-11e6-8f72-35f967836348.png "Tape Pass 0 Tests")

#### Add a Test

Going back to the requirements, we need our calculateChange method to accept
two arguments/parameters (**totalPayable** and **cashPaid**) and return an
array containing the coins equal to the difference:

e.g:

```
totalPayable = 210         // £2.10
cashPaid     = 300         // £3.00
difference   =  90         // 90p
change       = [50,20,20]  // 50p, 20p, 20p
```

Lets add a _test_ to `test/change-calculator.test.js` and watch it fail:

```javascript
const test = require("tape"); // assign the tape library to the variable "test"
const calculateChange = require("../lib/change-calculator.js"); // require the calculator module

test("calculateChange(215, 300) should return [50, 20, 10, 5]", function(t) {
  const result = calculateChange(215, 300); // expect an array containing [50,20,10,5]
  const expected = [50, 20, 10, 5];
  t.deepEqual(result, expected);
  t.end();
});
```

Re-run the test file: `node test/change-calculator.test.js`

![Tape 1 Test Failing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610528/70577c9a-7d16-11e6-925a-9858915316ca.png "Tape 1 Test Failing")

#### Export the `calculateChange` Function

Right now our `change-calculator.js` file does not _contain_ anything, <br />
so when it's `require`'d in the test we get a error:
`TypeError: calculateChange is not a function`

We can "fix" this by _exporting_ a function. add a single line to `change-calculator.js`:

```js
module.exports = function calculateChange() {};
```

Now when we run the test, we see more _useful_ error message:

![learn-tape-first-test-failing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610631/d30f9bd6-7d18-11e6-819b-0795c104e64f.png)

#### Write _Just_ Enough Code to Make the Test Pass

We can "fake" passing the test by by simply returning an Array in `change-calculator.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = function calculateChange(totalPayable, cashPaid) {
  return [50, 20, 10, 5]; // return the expected Array to pass the test
};
```

Re-run the test file `node test/change-calculator.test.js` (_now it "passes"_):

![Tape 1 Test Passes](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18610825/877be2f0-7d1e-11e6-9e8f-887e9700fd1b.png "Tape 1 Test Passes")

> **Note**: we aren't _really_ **_passing_** the test, we are _faking_ it
> for illustration.

#### Add _More_ Test Cases

Add a couple more tests to `test/change-calculator.test.js`:

```javascript
test("calculateChange(486, 600) should equal [100, 10, 2, 2]", function(t) {
  const result = calculateChange(486, 600);
  const expected = [100, 10, 2, 2];
  t.deepEqual(result, expected);
  t.end();
});

test("calculateChange(12, 400) should return [200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]", function(t) {
  const result = calculateChange(12, 400);
  const expected = [200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1];
  t.deepEqual(result, expected);
  t.end();
});
```

Re-run the test file: `node test/change-calculator.test.js` (_expect to see both tests failing_)

![learn-tape-two-failing-tests](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18611328/61787460-7d2d-11e6-8edc-8791f6d07fc3.png)

#### Keep Cheating or Solve the Problem?

We could keep cheating by writing a series of if statements:

```javascript
module.exports = function calculateChange(totalPayable, cashPaid) {
  if (totalPayable == 486 && cashPaid == 1000) return [500, 10, 2, 2];
  else if (totalPayable == 210 && cashPaid == 300) return [50, 20, 20];
};
```

But its arguably _more work_ than simply _solving_ the problem.
Let's do that instead. <br />

> **Note**: this is the _readable_ version of the solution!
> Feel free to suggest a
> [more _compact_ function](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd#solutions-).

Update the `calculateChange` function in `change-calculator.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = function calculateChange(totalPayable, cashPaid) {
  const coins = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1];
  let change = [];
  const length = coins.length;
  let remaining = cashPaid - totalPayable; // we reduce this below

  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    // loop through array of notes & coins:
    let coin = coins[i];

    if (remaining / coin >= 1) {
      // check coin fits into the remaining amount
      let times = Math.floor(remaining / coin); // no partial coins

      for (let j = 0; j < times; j++) {
        // add coin to change x times
        change.push(coin);
        remaining = remaining - coin; // subtract coin from remaining
      }
    }
  }
  return change;
};
```

> _**Note**: we **prefer** the "**functional programming**" approach
> when solving the calculateChange function._ <br /> > _We have used an "**imperative**" style here simply because
> it is more **familiar** to **most people** ... <br />
> If you are **curious** about the the **functional** solution,
> and you should be, <br />
> see_: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd#functional

#### Add More Tests!

Add _one more_ test to ensure we are _fully_ exercising our method:

```
totalPayable = 1487                                 // £14.87  (fourteen pounds and eighty-seven pence)
cashPaid     = 10000                                // £100.00 (one hundred pounds)
difference    = 8513                                 // £85.13
change       = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 10, 2, 1 ]   // £50, £20, £10, £5, 10p, 2p, 1p
```

```javascript
test("calculateChange(1487,10000) should equal [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 10, 2, 1 ]", function(t) {
  const result = calculateChange(1487, 10000);
  const expected = [5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 10, 2, 1];
  t.deepEqual(result, expected);
  t.end();
});
```

### _Bonus_ Level

#### Code Coverage

Code coverage lets you know _exactly_ which lines of code you have written
are "_covered_" by your tests (_i.e. helps you check if there is
"dead", "un-used" or just "un-tested" code_)
We use `istanbul` for code coverage.
If you are new to `istanbul` check out tutorial:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-istanbul

Install `istanbul` from NPM:

```sh
npm install istanbul -D
```

Run the following command (_in your terminal_) to get a coverage report:

```sh
node_modules/.bin/istanbul cover node_modules/.bin/tape ./test/*.test.js
```

You should expect to see something like this:

![learn-tape-coverage](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18611615/c1fe6322-7d36-11e6-8f3a-349d661ae012.png)

or if you prefer the **lcov-report**:

![Istanbul Coverage Report](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/18611640/b34aa308-7d37-11e6-936f-a1ff79511f0d.png "Istanbul Code Coverage Report")

> **100% Coverage** for Statements, Branches, Functions and Lines.

If you need a shortcut to running this command, add the following to the `scripts`
section in your `package.json`;

```sh
istanbul cover tape ./test/*.test.js
```

### Run your Tape tests in the browser

Follow these steps to run `Tape` tests in the browser:

1. You'll have to bundle up your test files
   so that the browser can read them. <br />
   We have chosen to use [`browserify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browserify) to do this. (_other module bundlers are available_). <br />
   You'll need to install it globally
   to access the commands that come with it. <br />
   Enter the following command into the command line:
   `npm install browserify -D`

2. Next you have to bundle your test files. Run the following browserify
   command:
   `node_modules/.bin/browserify test/*.js > lib/bundle.js`

3. Create a `test.html` file that can hold your bundle:
   `touch lib/test.html`

4. Add your test script to your newly created `test.html`:
   `echo '<script src="bundle.js"></script>' > lib/test.html`

5. Copy the full path of your `test.html` file
   and then paste it into your browser. <br />
   Open up the developer console
   and you should see something that looks like this:

![browser](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12450298/19898078/79f41d30-a052-11e6-954b-8dad5fa71771.png)

#### Headless Browser

You can print our your test results to the command line instead of the browser
by using a headless browser:

1. Install [`testling`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testling):
   `npm install testling -D`

2. Run the following command to print your test results in your terminal:
   `node_modules/.bin/browserify test/*.js | node_modules/.bin/testling`

3. You should see something that looks like this:
   ![testling](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12450298/19898553/63e0e8a0-a054-11e6-93e1-2fe4872989ed.png)

### Continuous Integration?

> If you are new to Travis CI check out our tutorial:
> https://github.com/dwyl/learn-travis

Setting up Travis-CI (_or any other CI service_) for your Tape tests
is quite straightforward. <br />
First define the `test` script in your `package.json`:

```sh
tape ./test/*.test.js
```

We usually let Travis send Code Coverage data to
[Codecov.io](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-istanbul#tracking-coverage-as-a-service)
so we run our tape tests using Istanbul (_see the coverage section above_):

```sh
istanbul cover tape ./test/*.test.js
```

Next add a basic `.travis.yml` file to your project:

```yml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "node"
```

And _enable_ the project on Traivs-CI. <br />
**Done**. [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/dwyl/learn-tape/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/dwyl/learn-tape)

# Can We Use Tape for _Frontend_ Tests?

Now that you've learned how to use Tape to test your back end code
check out our guide on
[frontend testing with tape](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tape/blob/master/front-end-with-tape.md).

# What about _Tap_?

We use **Tape** for _most_ of our JavaScript testing needs
[@dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl?language=javascript)
but _occasionally_ we find that having a few _specific_ extra functions
_simplifies_ our tests and reduces the repetitive "boilerplate".

If you find yourself needing a **`before`** or **`after`** function
to do "setup", "teardown" or resetting state in tests,
**_or_** you need to run tests in **_parallel_**
(_because you have lots of tests_),
then _consider_ using **`Tap`**:
